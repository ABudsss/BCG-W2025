# BCG-W2025
This project outlines a strategic international expansion plan for SkyLink Airlines, developed for the BCG Winter Case Competition 2025. It proposes a pilot entry into Colombia via Medellín and Cartagena—two cities with strong inbound tourism and fewer competitive or slot-related constraints compared to Bogotá.

The strategy includes detailed analysis of route viability, pricing structure, competitive positioning, and potential commercial partnerships. A flexible pilot approach is used to test demand, supported by SkyLink’s low-cost operating model and ability to maintain profitability even in competitive fare environments. The plan is designed to enable low-risk market entry with long-term scalability across Latin America.
